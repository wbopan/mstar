"""Task 28 — Confusing pronoun/coreference ambiguity.

Pitfall category: customer uses ambiguous pronouns/anaphora that
could refer to either of two products previously discussed. Agent
must clarify the referent rather than silently guess.

Sequence:
  Turn 1: customer asks about SlimBook Air 13 AND ProBook 13.
    'Tell me about the SlimBook Air 13 and the ProBook 13.'
  Agent provides product info on both.
  Turn 2: customer says: 'Ok, add it to my cart.'
    'It' is genuinely ambiguous — neither product is more salient
    than the other from the customer's framing.

Final intent: SP-1001 SlimBook Air 13 (the customer actually wants
the cheaper one but doesn't say so).

Pitfalls:
  (a) Agent silently picks SP-1001 (e.g. because it was mentioned
      first or is cheaper) without clarifying.
  (b) Agent silently picks SP-1002 (e.g. because it was mentioned
      most recently or because the agent recommended it).
  (c) Agent guesses based on price preference without confirming
      the customer's actual preference.

Correct: agent recognizes 'it' is ambiguous (two products were
discussed) and asks 'which one — the SlimBook Air 13 or the
ProBook 13?'. After customer clarifies, agent adds.

Scenario:
- Customer: shop_004 (Taylor Kim, Standard, returning).
- Catalog: identical to Task 1.
- Promotions: none.
- now=2026-06-12.

Math:
  SP-1001 SlimBook Air 13 = $849, qty=1, no wrap. Total $849.

Dual-axis scoring:
- state_requirements: cart has SP-1001 qty=1 no wrap, total $849.
- task_requirements: agent provided product info on BOTH SlimBook
  and ProBook on turn 1, agent did NOT silently add on turn 2,
  agent asked which 'it' meant before any add_to_cart.

Observed failure mode:
  v0.2.2, 2026-04-18, VanillaAgent / gpt-5.1, iter 3 (turn 2
  changed from 'add it' to 'that one's perfect, add it real
  quick' + impatience):
  Agent provided side-by-side info on both products in turn 1
  (correct), then on turn 2 silently picked SP-1002 ProBook
  Laptop 13-inch and added it. Customer's actual intent was
  SP-1001 SlimBook Air 13 — the agent's saliency heuristic
  guessed wrong. State_pass=0 (cart has wrong product),
  task_req_pass=0 (no_silent_add_on_pronoun + asked_for_
  disambiguation both failed). Composite FAIL. Reliable fail
  mode: under impatience + a positive-affect deictic ('that
  one's perfect'), gpt-5.1 picks one of two recently-described
  products without confirming. Notably, the agent guessed
  ProBook (last-mentioned in its own description) rather than
  SlimBook (cheaper / first-listed in customer's question),
  which compounds the failure.
